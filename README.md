# Dice-Game
This is a app game that can be used to function as a virtual dice in any board game. This is a try to revolutionalize traditional board games and make it a little technical. 
## Languages Used:
* Dart
* shell
* Objective C
* Java
## Functionality
As we open the app we will be able to see two dice sporting random values. As soon as we click on one of these dice the value of both the dice would change pointing to another set of random values. We can use this as a virtual replacement of the dice mainly used in board games.
